En effet, l’évaluation finale a rappelé la pertinence du programme transfrontalier et la nécessité de poursuivre l’action et a mis en exergue le besoin d’opérationnaliser le mécanisme d’alerte précoce transfrontalier, de redéfinir la zone d’intervention et de poursuivre les activités visant la résilience socioéconomique des femmes et des jeunes.

This project puts forward three key areas of action to transform people, practice and policies to enable more resilient agri-food systems centered around local communities to mitigate impact of Ukraine War: a) increasing human agency through strengthening adaptive capacities of farmers, women and local communicites in rural areas by expanding on digital literacy, digital financial inclusion and smart solutions for local communities, and risk insurance models for farmers and households (“People”), b) enhancing the resilience of agricultural practices in a manner that improves self suffieciency by piloting new high productivity, high resilience agricultural techniques that are dependent on geo data and remote sensing methods “Practice”, and c) promoting collective intelligence and inclusive dialogue to drive and inform policy advocacy and ensure that voices of local communities are represented and that decision makers are well informed of policy alternatives that help empower local communities and farmers mitigate the impact of the war on their livelihoods “Policy”.",https://open.undp.org/projects/01000483,Egypt,273102.0,5864.0,"Budget by year: 2024: $267,454.00; 2023: $5,648.00.
